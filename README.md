# Tin Can

OCaml one-on-one socket chat CLI app written with Riot for concurrency
and Mint Tea for terminal UI

To run: pin Riot to trunk and Minttea(and its related libraries Spices and Leaves)
to [this branch](https://github.com/leostera/minttea/tree/feat/upgrade-to-riot-30-03)

Can be laggy in default builds, best built with the `--release` flag or, even better, Flambda
